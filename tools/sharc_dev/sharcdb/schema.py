#
# --- v13: decode from LoadedMemory, not a code block's own stream bytes ----
#
# docs/findings/05-sharc-isa-and-decoding.md's "One decode path" section had
# already found (with tools/sharc_dev/sharc_coverage.py's --compare-decode-at) that a
# `code` loader block's own stream payload is not always what the image the
# emulator actually boots from holds at that address: a LATER block in the
# same boot stream can overwrite some or all of an earlier block's declared
# range before the whole stream finishes loading (LoadedMemory's documented
# last-write-wins resolution). Both places that built the `insn`/`functions`
# table's underlying decode -- this file's own per-code-block loop below and
# tools/sharc_dev/sharcinv.py's analyze_block()/build_inventory() (which this file's
# _fill_database() also calls, via tools/sharc_dev/sharcfn/'s load_context(), for
# function boundaries and call/jump/return sites) -- read a code block's OWN
# stream bytes (data[payload_offset:payload_offset+payload_len]). Both now
# instead read the block's declared [target_address, target_address+
# byte_count) range through a tools/sharc_dev/sharcldr.py LoadedMemory built over the
# whole stream, matching tools/sharc_dev/sharc_core/sequencer.decode_at()'s own input
# (no database access, LoadedMemory only) -- one decode INPUT as well as one
# decode function, for the same reason the "One decode path" section unified
# the decode FUNCTION.
#
# Two concrete, cross-checked consequences (see the finding for the byte-
# level evidence and the second-agent check):
#
#  1. Loader block 1 (all four images, target 0x282403f0, byte_count 10312)
#     is dead in the final image: 10304 of its own 10312 declared bytes
#     (99.92%, identical fraction and identical two 4-byte survivor gaps on
#     all four images) are overwritten by later blocks in the same stream --
#     mostly one large zero FILL, the rest small `data` blocks -- before
#     LoadedMemory's resolution is reached. No root or IVT slot enters it;
#     the many `dataref_code_pointer` roots and ~82 "functions" the old
#     per-block scan found inside it were themselves artifacts of decoding
#     these dead bytes as if they were live code (self-referential immediate
#     values that happen to land back in the block's own dead address
#     range). tools/sharc_dev/sharcinv.py's CODE_BLOCKS (and this file's
#     KNOWN_CODE_BLOCKS entries for all four images) no longer include it;
#     its blocks-table row now reports `kind='data'` (or 'fill'), matching
#     what the final image actually uses that address range for -- not a
#     "code" block LoadedMemory happens to give a different read for, but
#     not a program-code block at all. This removes the six `26a`-vs-`21a`
#     stale-bytes "SYNC" coverage gaps sharc_coverage.py --all-roots
#     reported at sw 0x1208e4/0x1208ff/0x12096d/0x12099c/0x1209b5/0x1209c4.
#
#  2. DN2 1.11/1.10E's loader block 57 (target 0x2001e888, byte_count 67652)
#     is NOT overwritten at all -- byte-for-byte identical to LoadedMemory
#     across its whole declared range -- but tools/sharc_dev/sharcldr.py's L2_BYTE_LIMIT
#     (previously 0x20020000, one 128 KB L2 SRAM bank) was too small: the
#     ADSP-2156x hardware reference documents 1 MB of L2 SRAM across eight
#     128 KB banks, and block 57 itself extends to 0x2002f1c4, 61,900 bytes
#     (91.5%) past the old bound. read_sw()'s L2 fallback bounds-checked
#     against that too-small limit and returned None there, which is what
#     tools/sharc_dev/sharc_coverage.py's --compare-decode-at reported as "stale
#     bytes" even though nothing in the boot stream ever touches those
#     bytes again -- a mapping bug, not a real overwrite. L2_BYTE_LIMIT is
#     now 0x20100000 (the full 1 MB window); block 57 stays in
#     KNOWN_CODE_BLOCKS, now correctly resolved end to end.
#
# `blocks` gained an `overwritten_bytes` column (tools/sharc_dev/sharcldr.py's new
# LoadedMemory.owner_runs()): for every non-FILL block, the count of its own
# declared bytes NOT owned by itself in the final image (0 = fully intact).
# General diagnostic, not just for the two cases above.
#
# --- v12: Type3d/4d/14d confident decode; Type15a mem_access/dataref fix ----
#
# Two independent changes:
#
# 1. decode_table.json promotes Type3d, Type4d and Type14d from
#    unconfirmed_bits>0 ("uncertain" -- no second source beyond the single
#    PRM figure, docs/findings/05's "SHARC+-only encodings with no second
#    source" list) to unconfirmed_bits=0 ("confident"). Checked two ways,
#    independently, and recorded in docs/findings/05-sharc-isa-and-decoding.md:
#    (a) raw bytes of individual dt2-1.16 instances, re-extracted bit-by-bit
#    from the manual's own figure geometry (not through sharc_isa.py),
#    reproduce the database's decoded fields exactly, and the mnemonic
#    suffix the existing renderer already picks for every real Type14d
#    instance matches the PRM's own (l,x,d) -> BH/BHSE-family syntax table
#    with no exceptions; (b) the addresses/registers each instance touches
#    (repeated DM globals, a function-prologue register-save idiom, the
#    already-[V] 0x82a00000 SoC command block) are the dataflow a compiler
#    would actually emit, and every one of the 158 whole-image instances
#    (87 on the sharc_coverage.py render path from 0x1c2b24) decodes a
#    clean, aligned successor instruction. This removes the
#    "provisional 14d/4d/3d: decode confidence uncertain" sharc_coverage.py
#    gaps and lets sharc_trace.py/sharc_run.py execute these forms without
#    passing them as provisional.
#
# 2. extract_mem_access()'s DIRECT_MEM_FORMS branch treated Type15a's
#    32-bit "addr" field as an absolute address (mem_access.abs_address),
#    the same wrong assumption the v6 `ptr`-table comment already flagged
#    and _ptr_mem_form() already avoids: sharc-plus-prm pp.387-390 (Figure
#    15-3, "DM(24,I5)=TCOUNT") gives Type15a as DM(<data32>,Ia)/PM(<data32>,
#    Ic) -- an I-register-relative access, not absolute, unlike 14a/14d
#    (which this branch also handles and which genuinely are absolute).
#    429 dt2-1.16 rows carried a negative offset such as -0x87 (I7-relative)
#    as abs_address 0xffffff79 -- indistinguishable from a real address near
#    the top of the 32-bit space. Fixed: Type15a now gets its own branch in
#    extract_mem_access, setting base_reg/modifier (the same columns
#    INDEXED_MEM_FORMS/IMMOFF_MEM_FORMS use for their own register-relative
#    accesses) from the manual's g/i-bank and sign-extended offset, and
#    leaving abs_address NULL. The parallel dataref bug -- extract_literal's
#    caller tagged Type15a's literal role='abs_load'/'abs_store' the same
#    way as Type14a's -- is fixed the same way: Type15a's literal now falls
#    through to role='literal' (a modify delta, like 16a/18a/19a*), not an
#    address. INDEXED_MEM_FORMS/IMMOFF_MEM_FORMS (3a/3b/3d/6a_mem/4a/4b/4d/
#    15b) were checked and never set abs_address in the first place: only
#    Type15a's presence in the DIRECT_MEM_FORMS grouping caused this.
#
# --- v11: Type14d/3b/3d/3d(ptr) mem_access/ptr width -------------------------
#
# The same class of bug v10 fixed for Type4b/4d: extract_mem_access()'s
# DIRECT_MEM_FORMS branch still used the generic "long if l else word"
# fallback for Type14d (wrong -- its l/x bits pick byte/short(-sign-
# extended), see _type14d_width()); its INDEXED_MEM_FORMS branch always
# recorded width=None for Type3b/3d instead of decoding their l/x/w (3b)
# or w/ex/l/x (3d) bits (see _type3d_width()); and _ptr_mem_form()'s own
# IMMOFF_MEM_FORMS branch had the same "long if l else word" mislabeling
# of Type4b/4d bug v10 fixed in extract_mem_access, now fixed by reusing
# _immoff_width() there too (width is descriptive only in `ptr` rows --
# address arithmetic is untouched).
#
# --- v10: MULT regdef/reguse naming, Type4b/4d mem_access width ------------
#
# _compute_regdef_reguse()'s MULT branch used classify_compute()'s is_float,
# which is wrong for every MULT opcode except 0x30 ("FN = FX*FY"): bit 3 of
# the mulop opcode is MOD1's Integer/Fraction result-format bit, not a
# float/fixed switch (PRM Table 18-7). regdef/reguse rows for other MULT
# opcodes (e.g. 0x48, "UUF"-style fixed-point multiplies) previously named
# F-registers where the manual calls for R-registers.
#
# extract_mem_access() also mislabeled Type4b/4d's l/x/w-encoded byte (bw)
# and short-word (sw) accesses as "word"/"long" (that fallback is only
# correct for forms whose lone "l" bit really means long-word); see
# _immoff_width() and sharc_trace.ACCESS_WIDTHS.
#
# --- v7: interrupt-vector roots ---------------------------------------------
#
# CMMR_SYSCTL.IIVT is set at boot (confirmed by the byte-exact slot targets
# below), so the IVT lives in L1 block 0's 48-bit (PM) space at the fixed
# short-word address IVT_SW -- sc58x-2158x-prm pp.226-231 ("L1 Memory
# Interface": "Block 0 has 256 addresses reserved for internal interrupt
# vector table"; the exact numeric address isn't in either public manual,
# "see the memory-map in the product specific data sheet") and
# sharc-plus-prm Table 4-47 (IIVT=1 -> L1) / Table 4-46 (the 32 interrupt
# names IVT_VECTOR_NAMES below reuses verbatim). _detect_interrupt_vector_roots()
# reads the 32x24-byte slot table there and adds a `roots` row per slot whose
# 4 instructions aren't the all-empty pattern, for every image (DT2 and DN2
# alike -- the location and slot layout were checked byte-for-byte identical
# across all four .sqlite images this repo builds). Two further ISR dispatch
# tables (IVT_DISPATCH_TABLES, an ASTATX-indexed and a SEC-id-indexed one)
# were checked the same way and found to sit entirely inside a boot-stream
# FILL block on DT2 1.16/1.15C (argument=0, i.e. the ROM ships them zeroed) --
# _detect_dispatch_table_roots() detects that case and adds no root rather
# than reporting an all-zero table as "no code pointers" by coincidence.
#
# --- v6: `ptr` -- constant-pointer propagation ------------------------------
#
# mem_access.abs_address (and dataref's resolved_offset) only ever resolved a
# direct absolute form or a same-block literal-then-immediate-offset pair;
# every other computed address -- a literal loaded into an I register three
# blocks earlier, a post-modify walk by a hardware-reset M constant, a
# spilled/reloaded call argument, a DM(I6+k) frame slot -- stayed invisible
# to "who writes address X". analyze_image() now also runs a small,
# deterministic forward constant-propagation per function (see
# _build_ptr_rows()'s own module note, just above it) and records every
# memory access it can pin to a known base register value or a fully known
# address in the new `ptr(image, sw, base_reg, base_value, address,
# direction, width)` table; tools/sharc_dev/sharc.py's Image.writers()/readers() query
# it. analyze()-only (no re-decode) is enough to backfill this on an
# existing database -- see analyze_image()'s own CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS.
#
# --- v5: reach now seeds from every root, not just function entries --------
#
# _detect_reach() used to drop a root whose address wasn't inside any
# function's [entry_sw, end_sw) span. The only root kind that can happen to
# (loader_entry -- see _detect_roots) was therefore silently missing from
# `reach` on every image: DT2 1.16 and DN2 1.11 both put their loader entry
# inside a `data` block immediately followed by `fill` padding, with no
# bblock/succ path bridging that padding into the first application
# function (checked directly against both images' bblocks/succ rows). See
# _detect_reach()'s own docstring for the fallback this version adds.
#
# --- ColdFire images (import_ghidra) -----------------------------------------
#
# build_ghidra_database() fills this SAME schema from a tools/coldfire/ghidradump.py
# dump directory (manifest.json/xrefs.sqlite/disasm/decomp) instead of
# decoding a SHARC+ blob, so every image -- SHARC or ColdFire -- is one
# `sharcdb.load()`/`sharc.py` API. meta.cpu is 'sharc' or 'coldfire';
# sharc.Image.trace() checks it and raises for a ColdFire image (no SHARC
# symbolic tracer for m68k). Column mapping, one column at a time:
#   - insn.sw / functions.entry_sw,end_sw / edges.from_sw,to_sw / dataref.sw:
#     the ColdFire BYTE address (there is no "short word" unit on this CPU;
#     the column is reused as-is rather than adding a parallel `addr` column
#     everywhere it's already keyed on `sw`).
#   - insn.raw: hex bytes exactly as tools/coldfire/ghidradump.py's disasm_line() wrote
#     them (concatenated 16-bit words, no spaces); insn.mnemonic: its
#     rendered text (Ghidra's CodeUnitFormat string, not ours); insn.block,
#     .form, .fields, .cond, .confidence: NULL (no per-instruction decode of
#     our own to fill them). insn.aligned is always 1 (Ghidra has already
#     disassembled every byte; there is no sweep/depth ambiguity to record).
#   - functions.block/.label/.entry_kind: NULL (no loader block, no SHARC
#     label pass); functions.has_static_caller/.is_leaf: from the `edges`
#     this same import wrote (any incoming/outgoing call edge), same
#     definition as the SHARC build.
#   - edges: one row per tools/coldfire/ghidradump.py `calls` row (already function-
#     level: a plain intra-function jump is dropped by that tool's own
#     collect(), never a reference at all). kind is the Ghidra reference type
#     with its UNCONDITIONAL_/COMPUTED_ prefix stripped down to this schema's
#     call/jump/cond_jump vocabulary (COMPUTED_* rounds down to the same kind
#     as its unconditional counterpart -- Ghidra had already resolved the
#     target, so there is no "unknown target" left the way SHARC's own
#     'indirect' kind means); the ORIGINAL Ghidra kind string (e.g.
#     "COMPUTED_CALL") is kept in `note` so that distinction isn't lost.
#     `fallthrough`/`return`/`indirect` never appear: a Ghidra dump has no
#     basic-block CFG to derive them from (see `bblocks`/`succ` below).
#   - dataref: one row per tools/coldfire/ghidradump.py `data_refs` row; value=to_addr,
#     sw=site, form='ghidra', role=the Ghidra kind lowercased
#     (read/write/read_write/data) -- not a SHARC form label (14a/17a/...),
#     since nothing here decoded the instruction that owns it.
#   - decomp(image, function_sw, c): decompiled C read verbatim from
#     tools/coldfire/ghidradump.py's own decomp/*.c (empty for a SHARC image, which
#     has no decompiler in this pipeline: Ghidra-only table, PK (image,
#     function_sw)).
#   - blocks, literals, mem_access, regdef, reguse, func_hash, bblocks, succ,
#     idom, loops: left EMPTY for a ColdFire image -- known gaps, not
#     silently-wrong data:
#       * blocks: Ghidra's own memory blocks (ram/MCF5441X_* MMIO regions)
#         don't fit this table's loader-block shape (idx/target_address/
#         byte_count); query xrefs.sqlite's own `blocks` table instead.
#       * literals/mem_access/regdef/reguse: instruction-decode facts this
#         import never computes (no re-disassembly of the ColdFire bytes;
#         Ghidra's own P-code has the same information but importing it is
#         future work, not done here).
#       * func_hash: relocation-tolerant hashing needs a decoder's own field
#         layout (SHARC's mask_relocatable); no ColdFire equivalent here, so
#         no cross-image function matching for ColdFire images yet.
#       * bblocks/succ/idom/loops: NO per-instruction CFG survives a Ghidra
#         dump at all -- tools/coldfire/ghidradump.py's collect() only records a
#         reference that is a CALL or a JUMP to a DIFFERENT function's entry
#         (see its build_rows()); an ordinary intra-function branch is never
#         turned into a reference, so this import cannot reconstruct basic
#         blocks, successors, dominators or loops. `functions`/`edges`
#         (function-level call graph) are still complete; analyze_image()'s
#         idom/loop pass simply sees no bblocks rows for this image and
#         produces no rows for it either (not an error).
#   - roots: the SHARC-only detectors (loader_entry, code_pointer_array,
#     rtos_task) are already gated on `mem`/`blocks`/the `literals` table,
#     which build_ghidra_database() never supplies, so they emit nothing for
#     a ColdFire image without a separate code path. dataref_code_pointer and
#     no_static_entry are already CPU-generic (pure SQL over
#     dataref/edges/functions) and fire the same way for both CPUs. The one
#     ColdFire-specific ADDITION is `vector_entry`: any function whose Ghidra
#     name matches `vector_<N>_handler` (an exception/interrupt vector table
#     entry Ghidra already named) -- a SHARC function is always named
#     FUN_%06x, so this pattern never matches there either, and needed no
#     cpu flag threaded through _detect_roots.
#   - reach/callgraph: fully reused (they only read edges/functions, both
#     CPU-generic tables).
